<center><p>What if a piece of software could tell you exactly what’s in front of you with one simple command? There would be no way that anyone could take advantage of a visually impaired person. Sound impossible?</p>

<p>Now introducing Third Eye, an innovative computer vision system designed for Google Glass. Simply say, “Okay Glass, recognize this” and Third Eye will analyze what’s in front of you and say what it is out loud. Third Eye can recognize almost all objects including money, landmarks, medicines, household objects, and regular text.</p></center>
